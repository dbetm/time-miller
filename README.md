### How does it work?

The fact is taken that each tic-tac that occurs every 1.25 seconds in the background music in the scenes of the planet Ocean "Miller" is equivalent to one full day (24 hours) on Planet Earth ðŸŒŽ.

It is taken as a fact that the movie was released on October 26th, 2014 at 00:00, relative to any time zone.


**Example**

If today is _Saturday, March 4th, 2023_ on Earth, then 3,051 days have passed here, which means 3,051 tick-tocks on Planet Miller, which are 3,051*1.25 seconds => 3,813.75 seconds => **1 hour, 3 minutes and 34 seconds**.
